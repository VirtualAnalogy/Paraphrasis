* This class provides storage for image resources. In order to make editing
* plugins efficient in Introjucer, all graphics are saved as resources in
* the Resources class and cached here. Each image can have three states:
* normal, alternate, and background.
*
* Usually you want to create a ResourceCache with the Resources::getCache()
* method, and passing the associated pointer to the GUI Component. Note that
* you must delete the ResourceCache created from this call when the GUI
* is destructed or closed, otherwise memory will be leaked.
